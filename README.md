USE GOOGLE APP SCRIPT AS A CODE EDITOR
this is one of my experiments with python , 
because when I was at the beginning I struggled with choosing one direction , frontend or backend ? 
and now when I'm about 1 year learning , practising and inshAllah soon planing to land a first job as a frontend Developer 
I wanna remember the old days when I tried to learn python
